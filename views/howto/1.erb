<p>Edit <code>lib/sitemap.rb</code> - it's a <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> app. You can keep it running while you work, it detects changes so you can check them in a browser as you make them. The routes should match the path of the HTML pages of the static site you're creating. Like this page right now is <code>/howto/1.html</code> and the previous one was <code>/index.html</code>.</p>

<p>Templates are in the <code>views</code> directory. Anything in the <code>public</code> directory (things like images and javascripts) will be copied as is when you generate the static site.</p>
  
<p>Once you're done creating content, run <code>rake</code> to output the static HTML site in a directory called <code>out</code>. That's it, upload the contents of <code>out</code> to a server and bye.</p>
